# Jupyter Notebook Tutorial

This is a repository containing Jupyter Notebooks from [this tutorial](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-for-beginners-a-tutorial-f55b57c23ada). 

It consists of some basic Jupyter Notebook commands and a data science project to analyse the profits and revenues of Fortune 500 companies spanning over 50 years since 1955. The dataset is taken from the [Fortuneâ€™s public archive](http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/full/2005/) and we have a csv of the data created in the main folder namded, `fortune500.csv`.

This a helpful [markdown tutorial]() which will help learn the markup language in depth to use in these notebooks.
